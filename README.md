# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)
This is "Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)" project form Hyperskill.<br>
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, nested lists, list comprehension, handling errors, and processing user input.<br>
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!<br>
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
